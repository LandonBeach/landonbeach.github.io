  <summary>Week 1</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Write a program that prints your name, major, year and academic interests.</li>
    <li>Illustrate the following operators: Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %; Relational operators: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=; and Logical operators: &&, ||, and !. Note that C does not have a primitive Boolean type.</li>
    <li>Use a for loop that computes and prints the powers of 2 from 2^1 to 2^20 (around a million).</li>
    <li>Write code that uses a for loop and prints out a list of the squares of n from n=1 to n=100, giving n and n^2 (ex. 3 -> 9).</li>
    <li>Write a function that prints out if an integer is even or odd. Test it on 4 different integers.</li>
    <li>Write and test a function that computes the distance between two points in 2D.</li>
    <li>Write and test a function that computes n values of the sine function evenly spaced between 0 and 2Pi.</li>
    <li>Write and test a function that simulates the rolling of two dice. It should take an integer n that determines how many times the dice are rolled then print a list showing the number of each possible outcome.</li>
  </ol>

  <summary>Week 2</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Write a program that, given positive integer n from the console, computes the first n fibonacci numbers (you probably don't want a recursive algorithm).</li>
    <li>Write a simple program that, given an integer n from the console, creates a pointer to n, then carefully explains (via printf statements) the difference between the pointer to n, the value of n, the & operator.</li>
    <li>Finish exercise 2 by explaining what the * operator does.</li>
    <li>Write a program that, given positive integer n from the console, passes the array [1,...,n] to a function which computes the square of each element and returns the result to the caller.</li>
    <li>Illustrate call by reference versus call by value using a function other than the cube function shown in class.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Week 3</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Write a function which takes two integer arrays and returns "true" if the two arrays have exactly the same elements.</li>
    <li>Write a word count macro.</li>
    <li>Write a program that leaks a lot of memory. It should be printing out how much memory was used until it crashes. How much memory was used before it crashed?</li>
    <li>Referring to the cplusplus documentation on the cmath library, test drive these functions: cos, exp, log, pow, sqrt, ceil, floor.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Week 4</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Referring to the cplusplus docs on the cstring library, write a test driver for the following string methods: strcat, strcmp, strlen, strtok.</li>
    <li>Write a program called "sum" that, when run from the command line sums all the numbers listed, ex., sum 1 2 3 4 would give 10. (Hint: use the command atoi.)</li>
    <li>Create and test a Student struct. It should have first name, last name, major and email address.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Week 5</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Add these methods to the Complex structure: add, mult., divide.</li>
    <li>Add code to the testppm program that automatically saves the image data to a file with a ppm extension.</li>
    <li>Create two new different and interesting images.</li>
    <li>Looking at the list of DOS commands, test 6 more commands executed within a C program.</li>
    <li>Add code to the testppm program that automatically opens your image in gimp after it is created.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Week 6</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Add code to the Mandelbrot program that writes the data to a file with ppm extension.</li>
    <li>Create 10 images: 5 zooming out and 5 zooming in, changing the scale a factor of 4 each time. Be sure to convert you ppm files to jpg or png.</li>
    <li>Write a flex specification that takes a file (like awmt.txt) and trims all multiple space or tab characters but leaves single spaces and writes this to a new file.</li>
    <li>Write a lex specification that reads an html file and strips all the tags and extra white space leaving only text and writes this to a file.</li>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Week 7</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Improve the wc lex specification to do the following:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>explain what the ouput means</li>
      <li>handle errors such as a non-existing file</li>
      <li>creates an output file (typed in at the command line) with detailed info on the results of running this program.</li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Week 8</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Take one program from each of weeks 1 through 4 and mand.c from week 5 and turn them into C++ programs that compile under g++. For the Mandelbrot program, use the C++ &ltcomplex&gt library. Also use &ltiostream&gt.</li>
  </ol>

<details>
  <summary>Week 10</summary>
  <ol>
    <li>Finish and test the code for the getters and setters of the ratio class.</li>
    <li>Implement and test a Point class for 3-D points. It should store the x, y, z values of a point and have these methods:</li>
      <ul><li>negative(), norm() i.e. its distance to the origin, print().</li></ul>
    <li>Implement and test a circle class. It should store the x, y coordinates for the center and radius and have these methods: area(), circumference(), getters and setters.</li>

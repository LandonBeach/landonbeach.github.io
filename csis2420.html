      <details>
        <summary>Test your environment by writing a static method that takes positive integer n as input and outputs an array of n random integers in the range 0 - 1,000,000. Test this method by calling it on n = 100 and printing the result.</summary>

  <summary>Week 2</summary>
  <ul>
    <details>
      <summary>Using just the Node class, create 4 different nodes and place in them: your Last name, First name, Major, Class level. Link them so they go in that order. Then write code which prints out the data, one piece of data per line, by starting at the first node and walking through the list.</summary>

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Add a Biginteger and a Character to the front of your list, and print the entire contents of your list. (Think about what you might want to do to make things faster).</summary>

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Write a test driver for your new List class. (Test all methods and constructors). Add four objects: BigInteger, String, Character, Integer, and print the contents. Remove the objects from the front one at a time and print the contents at each step.</summary>

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Add the following methods to the List code developed in class: insertAtBack() and removeFromBack(), which insert and remove objects from the back of the list. Run a test driver for these new methods using a List with the four elements in ex. 1 above. Show both the list code and the test driver code on your web page.</summary>

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Create a list and fill it with the squares from 1 to 100, then print out the contents.</summary>

    </details>
    <details>
      <summary>Have the last node of the List in ex. 5 point to the first node. What happens when you try to print the list? (In your web page, you just need to show the whole list printed twice).</summary>

    </details>
  </ul>
</details>

<details open="true">
  <summary>Week 3</summary>
  <ul>
    <details><summary>Add and test a method for the List class which returns the size of the list (i.e. the number of elements in the list). Show your new List class and the test driver in your website. Follow this pattern for all subsequent problems where you are asked to add new methods.</summary>

    </details>
    <details><summary>Add and test a method for the List class which returns a copy of the list.</summary>

    </details>
    <details><summary>Add and test static a method to the List class which appends one list to another and returns the result.</summary>

    </details>
    <details><summary>Write code that pushes 10 strings onto the stack (version 2), printing while it goes, then pops them off, printing while it removes.</summary>

    </details>
    <details><summary>Rewrite the Stack2 class using composition, and write an appropriate test driver. Then remove the print method and replace it with a "peek()" method that only returns the object at the top of the stack without removing it. Post the code for the final class which models the stack ADT.</summary>

    </details>
    <details><summary>Rewrite the Queue class using composition, and write an appropriate test driver. First, test it with the "print" method. Then remove the print method and replace it with a "peek()" method that only returns the object at the front of the queue without removing it. Post the code for the final class which models the queue ADT.</summary>

  <summary>Week 4</summary>
  <ul>

    <details><summary>Generate 10 random ints in the range 0 to 100, print them in the order they are generated and insert them into a tree constructed using just the TreeNode class. Print out the keys in such a way that it proves that the data was inserted in the way you expect. (Hint: look at the data we are inserting and draw the corresponding tree. Use the TreeNode methods to verify the data is where it is supposed to be).</summary>

    </details>
    <details><summary>Generate 1000 random ints in the range 0 to 1 million, print them in the order they are generated and insert them into the tree. Then do an inOrderTraversal which prints out the keys. What can you say about the values printed out? How fast is this algorithm on 1 million keys where the keys range from 0 to 1 billion (for timing purposes, you don’t need to print out). (Hint: use System.currentTimeMillis()).</summary>
